# Indigo

Indigo is a music player that utilizes YoutubeDL to
download songs that you would like to listen to! As
one of the Luminous Foundations first applications,
Indigo makes a point of being anti-corporate and
decentralized!

# How To Build

The dotnet project in ``Indigo.App/`` will build the
frontend & backend. Simply make sure you have dotnet 8
installed, and you can run the following:

```
dotnet build
```

After that dotnet will produce a binary capable of 
running the application!
